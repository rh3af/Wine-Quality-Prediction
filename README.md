# Wine-Quality-Prediction

The Wine Quality Prediction Project is a Big Data project designed to predict the quality of wines based on various attributes. The quality of RED and WHITE are predicted using Supervised Machine Learning Models which are Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression.
 This project uses Python and popular libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more to perform the following tasks:

- Data preprocessing to handle missing values in the dataset.
- Analysis of data attributes, including basic statistics, correlation analysis, and more.
- Visualization of data through bar graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
- Classification of wine quality as 'good', 'average', or 'poor'.
- Building and evaluating classification models using Random Forest and Logistic Regression.

The project aims to provide insights into the relationship between wine attributes and quality, as well as accurate quality predictions.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The project starts with data preprocessing to handle missing values in the dataset. The null values are replaced with the mean of the non-null values.

2. **Data Analysis**: Basic statistics, such as range, mean, mode, standard deviation, and median, are calculated for each attribute. Correlation analysis helps understand how different attributes are related to each other.

3. **Visualization**: The project includes various data visualization techniques, including bar graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to provide visual insights into the dataset.

4. **Classification**: The dataset is categorized into three quality categories: 'good', 'average', and 'poor'. Classification models, including Random Forest and Logistic Regression, are used to predict wine quality.

5. **Evaluation**: The accuracy of the classification models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, classification reports, and more.
